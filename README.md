# aliAnnotator

After trying most of the available annotators, I'm not happy with anyone off them. 
So this is my personal projeto where i will create the best annotator, where i will use machine learning to help people to anotate.
## It will be free.

Things i will use: 
 * c++ because I'm working with python and i dont want to forgot my best language
 * Qt for the interface
 * Random Forest or XGBoost: I will ask you to label 5-10 images and then i will use Random Forest or XGBoost to predict for the rest.(this part will be a help for laberling u can use it or not)
 * HSV filtering: for the same purpose.
 * Mini Image viewer, something like the preview in youtube.
